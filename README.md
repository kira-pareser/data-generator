# Introduction
Make sure generated data with feature selection better than non-feature selection model (Regression and Classification each model)
# Feature Selection Model
1. Correlation Coefficient (Pearson) 
2. Variance Threshold
3. Mutual Information
4. Forward Selection
5. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
6. Lasso
7. Ridge
8. Elastic Net
9. Random Forest
10. GBM
11. Factor Analysis
12. PCA
13. ICA
# Evaluation:
R2-Score for Regression
F1-Score for Classification
